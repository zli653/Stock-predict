Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation) where appropriate) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated? something you have collected personally, or by surveying your friends?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **We will be running your code**. Having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution will make it much easier for us to understand your project. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions. **Remember that if you do not write your description of the project and commeent your code well, we cannot understand what you have done. Even if it is technically brilliant, you will loose points if you do not write well and comment your code well.**\n",
